I'm a pre-final year Computer Science undergrduate student at [IIITDM Kancheepuram](http://www.iiitdm.ac.in/). Apart from academics I love contributing to Open Source.

My interests lie in **Fullstack Application Development**, **Deep Learning** and **Machine Learning**. I love creating applications which involve these things.
